# Online-Education-Adaptability-Analysis

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- One-hot encoding of categorical variables
- Application of Label Encoding to transform non-numerical labels into numerical labels
- Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree classifiers
- Evaluation of model performance with confusion matrix and classification report

## Visualizations
The repository includes histograms and heatmaps to visualize the distribution of data and the correlation between different factors affecting adaptability levels.

## Models
Two machine learning models are implemented:
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
2. Decision Tree Classifier

Both models are evaluated based on their accuracy and the detailed classification report is provided.

## Usage
To run the analysis, ensure you have the required libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Clone the repository and execute the Jupyter notebook or Python script.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or send suggestions to improve the analysis or add new features.
